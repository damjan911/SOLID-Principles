### SOLID Principles are the Design Principles that enable us to manage several Software Design Problems, which they must be followed to develop flexible, maintainable and scalable Software Systems. Each principle focuses on a specific aspect of Software Design.
### SOLID is an acronym for the following:<br>
   - [S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](#features)
   - [O: Open-closed Principle (OCP)](#features)
   - [L: Liskov substitution Principle (LSP)](#features)
   - [I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](#features)
